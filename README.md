# IUSLer Robotics Team

# About

IUSLer is a team that represents the Intelligent Unmanned Systems Laboratory (IUSL) at the Unmanned System Research Institute (USRI), Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU), China, founded in 2020, aiming to participate in robotics competitions.
Our team focuses on the research of perception, self-localization, and robot navigation in changing environments. Under our research objective, we have participated in a number of robot competitions including drone obstacle avoidance and F1TENTH autonomous racing (competitions under ICAUS 2021, 2022) in China. We are currently expanding our research into the area of multi-robot perception and mission planning and participate in RoboCup Rescue 2023 - Virtual Robot Simulation.
